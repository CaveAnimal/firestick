# Coverage Goals

- Overall target: ≥80% line coverage on core modules.
- Critical paths: 90%+ for indexing pipeline, search, and graph analysis services.
- Exclusions: generated code, configuration classes, DTOs without logic.
- Review: monitor `target/site/jacoco/index.html` in CI and locally after significant changes.
