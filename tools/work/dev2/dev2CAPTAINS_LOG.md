- [2025-10-22 00:00] DEV2-REACT-TASKS-SYNC — What: Sync Phase 5 React tasks from `tools/plans/firesticReactTasks.md` into `tools/work/dev2/tasksDEV2.md` | Why: Keep DEV2 plan aligned with source tasks while avoiding token overruns by chunked verification per section.
- [2025-10-22 00:10] DEV2-REACT-TASKS-SYNC — Work done: Mapped headings; verified all Week 11–12 React tasks (search UI, Monaco code viewer, graph foundation/features, dashboard, indexing console, polish/testing) already present in `tasksDEV2.md`; no insertions required; updated "Last Updated" date. | Result: `tasksDEV2.md` is in sync with `firesticReactTasks.md`; no duplication; formatting preserved.
