## 6. Risk Management

### 6.1 Risk Register

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **R1** | Chroma Java client integration fails | Medium | High | Use REST API fallback, consider pgvector alternative | Backend Dev |
| **R2** | ONNX model performance too slow | Medium | High | Use quantized models, batch processing, consider lighter model | Backend Dev |
| **R3** | Memory usage exceeds 4GB for large codebases | Medium | Medium | Implement streaming, pagination, lazy loading | Backend Dev |
| **R4** | Graph visualization slow for large graphs | Low | Medium | Progressive rendering, limit node count, zoom-based loading | Frontend Dev |
| **R5** | Cross-platform packaging issues | Medium | High | Early testing on all platforms, use VMs for testing | DevOps |
| **R6** | Search accuracy below 80% | Low | High | Improve chunking strategy, adjust ranking algorithm | Backend Dev |
| **R7** | Team member availability issues | Medium | Medium | Cross-training, documentation, modular design | Tech Lead |
| **R8** | Scope creep pushing timeline | High | High | Strict scope management, defer features to v1.1 | Tech Lead |
| **R9** | Browser compatibility issues | Low | Low | Test early, use standard web technologies | Frontend Dev |
| **R10** | Dependency conflicts in embedded distribution | Medium | Medium | Test thoroughly, document dependencies | DevOps |

### 6.2 Risk Mitigation Plans

#### R1: Chroma Integration Risk
**Mitigation Steps:**
1. Week 5 Day 1: Evaluate both REST API and Java client approaches
2. Create proof of concept with both approaches
3. If both fail, implement fallback: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension
4. Alternative: Build simple in-memory vector store with FAISS

**Contingency:** Add 1 week buffer if major rework needed

#### R2: ONNX Performance Risk
**Mitigation Steps:**
1. Benchmark early in Week 4
2. If slow, try quantized INT8 model (trade accuracy for speed)
3. Implement aggressive batching (batch size 32-64)
4. Consider using all-MiniLM-L12-v2 (smaller, faster)
5. Add progress indicators to manage user expectations

**Contingency:** If still slow, limit semantic search to smaller scopes

#### R8: Scope Creep Risk
**Management Process:**
1. Maintain strict feature freeze after Week 10
2. All new feature requests go to v1.1 backlog
3. Weekly scope review in sprint planning
4. Tech lead has veto power on scope additions
