## Critical Coordination Points

### 1. Week 2, Day 9-10: API Contract Definition
**Required:** Both developers must meet to:
- Define all REST API endpoints
- Agree on request/response formats
- Document error codes
- Create OpenAPI specification
- Set expectations for Phase 5

**Deliverable:** API contract document signed off by both developers

---

### 2. Week 8, Day 38-40: Integration Checkpoint
**Required:** Verify readiness for UI development
- All backend APIs complete
- API documentation finalized
- Test all endpoints
- Resolve any API issues
- Plan Phase 5 kickoff

**Deliverable:** Backend API sign-off, Phase 5 ready to start

---

### 3. Week 12, Day 68-69: Final Integration
**Required:** Complete end-to-end testing
- Full stack integration testing
- Performance validation
- Bug fixes
- Final QA
- Release preparation

**Deliverable:** Application ready for v1.0.0 release

---

## Communication Guidelines

### Daily Standups (15 minutes)
**Time:** 9:00 AM daily  
**Format:**
- What I did yesterday
- What I'm doing today
- Blockers/needs

### Weekly Sync (1 hour)
**Time:** Friday 2:00 PM  
**Agenda:**
- Review week's progress
- Plan next week
- Resolve blockers
- Update task status

### Ad-hoc Coordination
**Use when:**
- API contract questions
- Data format issues
- Integration problems
- Blocking issues

---

## Conflict Resolution

### If work overlaps or conflicts:
1. **Communication first** - Discuss immediately
2. **Document decision** - Update both task files
3. **Update master** - Use scripts to refresh the master `## Task Summary` in `firestickTASKS.md`
4. **Assign clear owner** - One person responsible per file/feature

### Common overlap areas:
- API contracts → Developer 1 owns backend, Developer 2 reviews
- Data models → Developer 1 creates, Developer 2 validates for UI needs
- Integration tests → Developer 2 writes, Developer 1 supports
- Documentation → Shared responsibility

---

## Progress Tracking

### Per-developer wrappers (recommended)
```powershell
# Developer 1
tools\work\dev1\scripts\dev1-check.ps1      # read-only status for tools/work/dev1/tasksDEV1.md
tools\work\dev1\scripts\dev1-update.ps1     # updates tools/work/dev1/tasksDEV1.md and master summary

# Developer 2
tools\work\dev2\scripts\dev2-check.ps1      # read-only status for tools/work/dev2/tasksDEV2.md
tools\work\dev2\scripts\dev2-update.ps1     # updates tools/work/dev2/tasksDEV2.md and master summary
```

### Core scripts (advanced usage)
```powershell
# Update specific tasks files (personal)
tools\plans\scripts\update-task-summary.ps1 -TasksFilePath "tools/work/dev1/tasksDEV1.md" -SummaryHeader "## Task Summary (DEV1)"
tools\plans\scripts\update-task-summary.ps1 -TasksFilePath "tools/work/dev2/tasksDEV2.md" -SummaryHeader "## Task Summary (DEV2)"

# Check a specific tasks file
tools\plans\scripts\check-task-status.ps1 -TasksFilePath "tools/work/dev1/tasksDEV1.md"
tools\plans\scripts\check-task-status.ps1 -TasksFilePath "tools/work/dev2/tasksDEV2.md"
```

### Weekly Status Updates
Each Friday, both developers should:
1. Update task statuses in their document
2. Run update-task-summary.ps1
3. Commit changes to git
4. Review overall progress

## Tips for Success

### For Developer 1 (Backend)
- Focus on API quality over speed
- Document all endpoints clearly
- Communicate API changes immediately
- Provide sample responses early
- Think about frontend needs

### For Developer 2 (Frontend)
- Start UI planning early (Weeks 3-8)
- Create mockups and get feedback
- Test with mock data first
- Communicate UI needs to backend
- Think about user experience

### For Both Developers
- **Communicate early and often**
- Don't wait until blockers become critical
- Update task status regularly
- Help each other when needed
- Celebrate milestones together

---

## Success Metrics

### Individual Metrics
- Tasks completed on time
- Code quality (test coverage, reviews)
- Documentation completeness
- Communication effectiveness

### Team Metrics
- Integration points successful
- Minimal merge conflicts
- No critical blockers lasting >1 day
- On track for 12-week delivery

---

## Emergency Procedures

### If Developer 1 is blocked:
1. Update task status to `[!]` Blocked
2. Notify Developer 2 immediately
3. Document blocker reason
4. Find alternative tasks
5. Escalate if needed

### If Developer 2 is blocked:
1. Update task status to `[!]` Blocked
2. Notify Developer 1 immediately
3. Document blocker reason
4. Work on alternative phase if possible
5. Escalate if needed

### If integration fails:
1. Don't panic - it's normal
2. Identify root cause together
3. Create integration test
4. Fix and verify
5. Document lesson learned

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if I finish my tasks early?**  
A: Great! Help the other developer, improve tests, enhance documentation, or start next phase planning.

**Q: What if I'm behind schedule?**  
A: Communicate immediately. Re-prioritize tasks, defer non-critical items, ask for help.

**Q: Can I modify firestickTASKS.md?**  
A: No, keep it as reference. Modify only your assigned file (tasksDEV1.md or tasksDEV2.md).

**Q: What if API contract needs to change?**  
A: Discuss together, document change, update both task files, communicate impact.

**Q: Can we work on same files?**  
A: Avoid when possible. If necessary, communicate frequently and use git branches.
