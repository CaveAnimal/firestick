Create the PRD Document
Review the conversations01.md and teh current state of the project and create a PRD named firestickPRD.md and save it in /tools/plans

Create the Planning Document
Using conversations01, curernt state of the project, and the prd, develope a plannig document named firestickPLANNING.md and save it in /tools/plans

Create Tasks Document
Using the conversations01 file, current state of the project, the PRD, and the planning documents, develop a comprehensive task document named firestickTASKS.md and save it in /tools/plans.
This Tasks document should be written for a young new team of assistants/developers. Make the tasks as clear and as simple as possible so that developers can show progress each day. Break tasks down further into sub-tasks if it will be useful.
Include the following Task Management System advice at the top of the document:
## Task Status Symbols
The assistants/developers will maintain task status using these symbols:
- `[ ]` Not Started
- `[-]` In Progress
- `[X]` Completed
- `[V]` Tested & Verified
- `[!]` Blocked
- `[>]` Deferred (include reason on next line)
"Sorry, the response hit the length limit. Please rephrase your prompt."
Rewrite Prompt 1: Create Tasks Document for each phase.


Prompt 1a: Create Tasks Document - Phase 1 (Foundation)
Using the conversations01 file, current state of the project, the PRD, and the planning documents, develop tasks for Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2) only.
Create a document named firestickTASKS.md and save it in /tools/plans.
This Tasks document should be written for a young new team of assistants/developers. Make the tasks as clear and as simple as possible so that developers can show progress each day. Break tasks down further into sub-tasks if it will be useful.
Include the following Task Management System advice at the top of the document:
## Task Status Symbols
- `[ ]` Not Started
- `[-]` In Progress
- `[X]` Completed
- `[V]` Tested & Verified
- `[!]` Blocked
- `[>]` Deferred (include reason on next line)
Focus only on Phase 1 tasks: Spring Boot setup, Chroma integration, local embedding model setup, and initial test pipeline.


Prompt 1b: Create Tasks Document - Phase 2 (Code Indexing)
Append to the existing firestickTASKS.md in /tools/plans.
Add tasks for Phase 2: Code Indexing Engine (Weeks 2-4) only.
Make the tasks clear and simple for junior developers. Include sub-tasks where helpful.
Focus on: JavaParser integration, chunking strategy, dependency graph building, and indexing pipeline.

Prompt 1c: Create Tasks Document - Phase 3 (Query Engine)
Append to the existing firestickTASKS.md in /tools/plans.
Add tasks for Phase 3: Query Engine (Weeks 4-6) only.
Make the tasks clear and simple for junior developers. Include sub-tasks where helpful.
Focus on: hybrid search implementation, query processors, and context assembly.

Prompt 1d: Create Tasks Document - Phase 4 (Analysis Features)
Append to the existing firestickTASKS.md in /tools/plans.
Add tasks for Phase 4: Analysis Features (Weeks 6-8) only.
Make the tasks clear and simple for junior developers. Include sub-tasks where helpful.
Focus on: static analysis tools, pattern recognition, and documentation generation.

Prompt 1e: Create Tasks Document - Phase 5 (Web UI)
Append to the existing firestickTASKS.md in /tools/plans.
Add tasks for Phase 5: Web UI (Weeks 8-10) only.
Make the tasks clear and simple for junior developers. Include sub-tasks where helpful.
Focus on: REST API development, web interface creation, and interactive features.

Prompt 1f: Create Tasks Document - Phase 6 (Desktop Packaging)
Append to the existing firestickTASKS.md in /tools/plans.
Add tasks for Phase 6: Desktop Packaging (Weeks 10-11) only.
Make the tasks clear and simple for junior developers. Include sub-tasks where helpful.
Focus on: application bundling, launcher creation, and platform testing.

Prompt 1g: Create Tasks Document - Phase 7 (Optimization)
Append to the existing firestickTASKS.md in /tools/plans.
Add tasks for Phase 7: Optimization & Polish (Week 12) only.
Make the tasks clear and simple for junior developers. Include sub-tasks where helpful.
Focus on: performance tuning, user experience improvements, and documentation.



Create Examples/Advice Document
In parallel with the Tasks document, create an examples document named firestickEXAMPLES.md and save it in /tools/plans.
The examples document should be labeled in the same way as the tasks and should provide sample code and/or advice for each task where it could be useful to a junior developer.


Divide Tasks Between Two Developers
After the tasks and examples documents are completed, imagine there are currently two developers assigned to work on this project.
Without changing the firestickTASKS.md document, divide the tasks logically and as equally as possible, so that two developers can work on the project simultaneously.
Name the new documents tasksDEV1.md and tasksDEV2.md and save them in /tools/plans.
